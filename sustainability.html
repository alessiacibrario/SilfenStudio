          The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries
          worldwide, and one of the biggest issues is the use and contamination
          of drinking water. We try to minimize the water consumption in our
          production in an effort to decrease its negative impact on the
          environment and to ensure local access to clean water.<br />
          All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from
          eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less
          consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our
          cotton, than conventional cotton products.<br />
          In 2020 we will introduce a new collection of bags made from a new
          material; rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled
          material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
          oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the
          world.

          We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on
          our planet. Because of this, we strive to choose
          environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in
          close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as
          much as possible – by joining forces.<br />
          We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or
          train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of shipping,
          reducing polluting emissions.

          At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning
          obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but
          also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that
          it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct
          within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the
          ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our
          suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our
          factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to put
          their children in school.
        </p>

          Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as
          well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all
          employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement.

          We support the different religions of employees and protect their
          right to engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn
          discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from
          prejudice and injustice at the workplace.

          We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the
          issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution
          etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is
          always crafted in a responsible manner.

            COTTON<br />
            Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton – a fabric commonly
            known as polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from
            eco-friendly or organic cotton. Both materials require far less
            water consumption than conventional cotton products. Every nylon
            product is made from eco-friendly material, meaning that the journey
            from raw material to SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little as
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            LEATHER<br />
            All leather goods are made from sustainable high-quality calf
            leather and is a bi product of the food industry, meaning that every
            part of the animal is utilized in various industries. We love colors
            and new trends, but we incorporate consciousness and quality in our
            design processes to retain timelessness in all products. All our
            components, zippers, thread, reinforcement, glue etc., are made from
            high-quality raw materials. We encourage our customers to take good
            care of their bag, prolonging the life of the product. By caring for
            your bag, you will be able to create more experiences with it – an
            important factor in creating a more sustainable, mindful business.

            VEGAN<br />
            In 2019, we presented our first vegan option in a collection, and we
            have continued to this since then. We make sure that all non-leather
            material – e.g. our nylon, lacquer – are all 100% vegan, promising
            that these products do not contain any parts from animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            rPET line<br />
            In 2020 we are expecting to launch a new collection manufactured in
            rPET, recycled polyethylene terephthalate. The material is well
            known as it is made from water bottles across the world – bottles
            that often end up discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled
            material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
            oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the
            world. With this new collection, we aim to emphasize the impact of
            pollution irresponsible wasting. We wish to pass this awareness to
            our customers, and to encourage them to help clean our oceans!
